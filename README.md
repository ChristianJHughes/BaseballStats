# BaseballStats
<b>Allows traversal of standardized Baseball records, using a native hash map implementation. Created with C#.</b>

This application parses MLB season logs (.csv files) available from [here](http://www.retrosheet.org/gamelogs/index.html), and allows the user to get the game statistics from any game therein. Performnace is extremely fast, despite parsing text files that are many MBs in size.
